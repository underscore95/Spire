# Building

Tests run automatically when Spire or SpireVoxel is built.

Tests can be manually executed by running the SpireTests or SpireVoxelTests targets.

Note: Tests don't seem to be executing when running a target even if that target causes a rebuild of a tested project in CLion, you must explicitly build the project to run tests.
